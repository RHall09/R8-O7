Major Design Decisions</h1>
<p >The first major decision we made was the microcontroller. Primarily driven by the ESP32’s built in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules, the ESP32 was selected. Further, we decided to use Adafruit’s HUZZAH32 Feather as it is compatible with a commercially available GPS breakout board. This board does present one major restriction: the general lack of GPIO pins. This became a major design factor. Initially, we considered using a secondary MCU to govern ShowSense behaviors connected to the main ESP32 via I2C. This consideration was ultimately disregarded as we decided to limit ShowSense moments to very simplistic rotations at this phase. <br  />
 <br  />
We then decided on the method of containing the bot within a digital fence. This can be accomplish by a variety of methods, but outside of GPS coordinates, all those methods rely on an external device. Initially, we considered tethering the bot to a user phone and limiting the distance the bot is allowed to travel from the phone, however this violated the desire for true autonomous behavior. This then required a GPS based solution. The most commonly used formed of GPS containment is geofencing. As such, we utilized a geofencing based approach with a predefined fence of latitude and longitude points. <br  />

Sensors, Actuators, and Electronics</h1>
<p >The specifications require that R8-07 is capable of reliably avoiding collision with humans in crowded situations. This requires a sensor suite capable of sensing moving, human obstacles reliably in a variety of settings collectively referred to as the “Safety Sensor Suite.” This specification drove the selection of three independent distance sensors capable of sensing objects and their distance from the sensor: <br  />
• Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04): These sensors reliable sense objects via the reflection of sound waves. They are generally reliable but may be impacted by sonically absorptive material. <br  />
• Laser-based Time of Flight Sensors: These sensors measure distance by tracking the time a laser is in flight and reflected to the sensor. They are highly reliable but may be undermined by particularly light absorbent material. <br  />
• Infrared Sensors: These sensors function similar to the laser-based time of flight sensors but use infrared light instead of laser reflections. They are less reliable than their laser counterparts but are undermined by a different spectrum of absorptivity than the lasers. <br  />
 &lt;INSERT GRAPHIC OF SAFETY SENSOR SUITE LAYOUT HERE&gt; The sensors were laid out according to FIGURE. This arrangement creates a double redundancy on R8-07’s main heading while using two ultrasonic sensors to develop a cone of information. This allows R8-07 to make intelligent decisions regarding turning directions if in a dense crowd. <br  />
Further, according to the specification regarding foot collisions, three additional distance sensors are required to ensure that the wheel base is clear for the maneuvers it is undertaking. These are angled at 22.5⁰ pointing approximately four inches in front of the pinch point for each wheel. This is accomplished using the angled blocks seen below. The main point is equipped with an additional laser-based time of flight sensor, while each of the drive wheels is equipped with an additional ultrasonic distance sensor. <br  />
<br  />
 &lt;INSERT FIGURE OF ANGLED BLOCKS&gt; For this initial phase, only two drive motors are used to drive R8-07. No additional actuators are used. Maximum estimates of R8-07’s laden weight with all attached peripherals totaled 50 pounds. As such, motors were selected to handle this load according to the calculations shown in APPENDIX A. Motors meeting these qualifications were sourced from Pololu (item number 4694). Characteristics of the motor are shown below. <br  />

<p> A motor driver capable of reliably carrying 24V was then selected based off availability. The MD L6205D chip was selected. This chip and its necessary associated components were mounted on an expansion board designed around the HUZZAH32 feather. The motor driver chip and its components are outlined in blue in the board rendering below. <br  />
 <br  />
 The hardware design of R8-07 is built around the HUZZAH32 Feather from Adafruit. Most of the decisions regarding the expansion board for the feather were driven by the pin limitations of the feather board. Because of the relatively low number of GPIO pins on the feather and the high demand for GPIO pins from the required sensor suite, two GPIO expansion buses, one analog and one digital, were added to the expansion board, highlighted in red in the board rendering below. To limit communication protocols and take advantage of the daisy chaining capabilities of the I2C protocol, we sought out I2C capable expansion buses. We selected the PCA9534 8-bit I2C bus I/O port with interrupt for the digital expansion. This chip was selected because of its interrupt capabilities and setup in order to easily accommodate typical ultrasonic distance setups. We then selected the ADS7828 chip for the analog expansion bus. The 12-bit resolution and built-in analog to digital converter made it optimum for easy integration with minimal GPIO usage. <br  />

Custom Expansion Board with Highlighted Segments</div></div>
<p >Highlighted in orange in the board rendering are three additional components designed to ease testing and assembly operations. First, a set of screw terminals linked to the I2C bus was included to easily expand devices using the I2C communication protocol. This proved useful for the inclusion of the laser time of flight breakout boards, which communicated over I2C. Two user pushbuttons and two LEDs were also included in this section, primarily for testing purposes. Jumpers toggled the use of the LED or the pushbutton. The set of push buttons facilitated testing of the I2C expansion chips, as pushing a button could be used to trigger an output attached to the chip. The LEDs also proved useful during testing of the roaming bot, as they could serve as a visual indicator of where in the program the bot currently was. <br  />

Mechanical Design</h1>
<p >R8-07’s mechanical structure design was driven by two key limitations: position safety sensors and building a frame for scenic elements to mimic the R5 structure. To ease this process and allow for continued focus on the electronics design, open-source designs of an R5 unit were downloaded and modified from the R2 Building community Astromech.net. Under their open-source licenses, these files were available to use for noncommercial operation of the unit. The license also allowed for modifications that proved necessary for ease of function. <br  />
 <br  />
 There were two major modifications to the open-source files necessary. First and foremost, the files needed to be modified to easily house the sensor suite at an appropriate level to avoid both adults and children. The body frame, shown below, was modified to allow for these sensors to all be housed on the same plane. The files were also modified to accommodate for the change in build materials. The files were designed to be made from 3mm polystyrene plastic. However, polystyrene cannot be laser cut as it releases toxic styrene gas. As such, we pivoted to using quarter inch plywood to form the skeleton. This necessitated some adjustments in the various file sizes to account for the tolerance buildup as the bot was built. <br  />

<p >While the files for building a full R5 unit have been adjusted, only the body and legs are currently in use. Further, motors were temporarily mounted on an adjoining strut for testing purposes at this time. </p>
