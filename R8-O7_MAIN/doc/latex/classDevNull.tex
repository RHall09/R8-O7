\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class which doesn\textquotesingle{}t print anything when debugging printouts have been turned off. 

This class doesn\textquotesingle{}t really do anything. It is provided as a target for definitions of {\ttfamily operator\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}} as provided by the Print\+Stream library, which originally comes from {\ttfamily \href{https://github.com/tttapa/Arduino-PrintStream}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/tttapa/\+Arduino-\/\+Print\+Stream}}} and has been forked on the Spluttflob ME507 Git\+Hub site.

The constructor creates an inert debug printer which does nothing except take the place of a {\ttfamily Print} child class such as a serial port when one doesn\textquotesingle{}t want debugging printouts but would rather not delete code which creates those printouts...because who knows when a bug may appear and those printouts will be needed again.
