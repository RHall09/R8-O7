\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Data which can be shared between tasks in a thread-\/safe manner. 

This file contains a template class for data which is to be shared between tasks. The data must be protected against damage due to context switches, so it is protected by a mutex or by causing transfers to take place inside critical sections of code which are not interrupted. This version is known to work on S\+T\+M32\textquotesingle{}s and E\+S\+P32\textquotesingle{}s only because the insertion and extraction operators {\ttfamily $<$$<$} and {\ttfamily $>$$>$} need specific functions to determine if they\textquotesingle{}re running in I\+SR\textquotesingle{}s or not.

\begin{DoxyDate}{Date}
2012-\/Oct-\/29 J\+RR Original file 

2014-\/Aug-\/26 J\+RR Changed file names, class name to {\ttfamily Task\+Share}, removed unused version that uses semaphores, renamed {\ttfamily put()} and {\ttfamily get()} 

2014-\/Oct-\/18 J\+RR Added linked list of all shares for tracking and debugging 

2020-\/Oct-\/10 J\+RR Made compatible with Arduino, class name to {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classShare}{Share}}} 

2020-\/Nov-\/14 J\+RR Added new-\/\+E\+S\+P32 compatible {\ttfamily S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+\_\+}...\+\_\+\+C\+R\+I\+T\+I\+C\+A\+L(x); added {\ttfamily $<$$<$} and {\ttfamily $>$$>$} operators 

2020-\/Nov-\/18 J\+RR Critical sections not reliable; changed to a queue 

2021-\/Sep-\/17 J\+RR Changed some {\ttfamily put} params from references to copies 

2021-\/Sep-\/19 J\+RR Added overloads for {\ttfamily get()} which return values
