\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a class which implements a Free\+RTOS queue specifically for text, allowing a stream insertion operator to be used to put all sorts of things (strings, numbers, {\itshape etc}.) into the queue. The stream extraction operator has been tested on STM32\textquotesingle{}s and ESP32\textquotesingle{}s only; the extraction operator {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} needs somewhat processor specific functions to determine if it\textquotesingle{}s running in an ISR or not.
