\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a class which implements a Free\+R\+T\+OS queue specifically for text, allowing a stream insertion operator to be used to put all sorts of things (strings, numbers, {\itshape etc}.) into the queue. The stream extraction operator has been tested on S\+T\+M32\textquotesingle{}s and E\+S\+P32\textquotesingle{}s only; the extraction operator {\ttfamily $>$$>$} needs somewhat processor specific functions to determine if it\textquotesingle{}s running in an I\+SR or not.
