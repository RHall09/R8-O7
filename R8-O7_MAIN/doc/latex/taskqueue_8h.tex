\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a very simple wrapper class for the Free\+R\+T\+OS queue. It makes using the queue just a little bit easier in C++ than it is in C. This version has been tested on S\+T\+M32\textquotesingle{}s and E\+S\+P32\textquotesingle{}s only because the insertion and extraction operators {\ttfamily $<$$<$} and {\ttfamily $>$$>$} need specific functions to determine if they\textquotesingle{}re running in I\+SR\textquotesingle{}s or not.

\begin{DoxyDate}{Date}
2012-\/Oct-\/21 J\+RR Original file 

2014-\/Aug-\/26 J\+RR Changed file names and queue class name to \mbox{\hyperlink{classQueue}{Queue}} 

2020-\/Oct-\/10 J\+RR Made compatible with Arduino/\+Free\+R\+T\+OS environment 

2020-\/Nov-\/18 J\+RR Added {\ttfamily $<$$<$} and {\ttfamily $>$$>$} operators for E\+S\+P32 and S\+T\+M32 

2021-\/Sep-\/19 J\+RR Added overloads of {\ttfamily get()}, {\ttfamily I\+S\+R\+\_\+get()}, {\ttfamily peek()}, and {\ttfamily I\+S\+R\+\_\+peek()} which return copies
