<div class="textblock"><p >Near the end of the project, we began the final integration of the microcontroller into the assembled hardware for R8-O7. During this process, we ran tests of several of our primary software systems to verify integration with our constructed hardware. Unfortunately, during the testing of the motor driver and control system, the motor driver chip on the PCB burnt out after prolonged testing, despite operating notably under the current limit for the chip. The chip was replaced with a backup, however upon connecting the backup to 24V power it immediately burnt out, leaving us without the ability to drive the 24V motors. <br  />
 <br  />
 fter the malfunction of the motor driver chips, we were not able to use the full frame of R8-O7 for testing of our software, to which the primary safety sensor suite was attached. In an attempt to verify functionality of our code, we loaded a heavily modified version of our program onto a small testing bot (occasionally referred to as BabyBot) that we had used for preliminary single-sensor object avoidance testing. Due to significant differences in the operation of the motors and the lack of the primary sensor suite, neither the object avoidance algorithm nor the motor control system were utilized in the testing bot. <br  />

<p> With the test bot, we were able to define a geofence for testing within the tennis courts located on Cal Poly campus and test the geofence algorithm, to mixed results. The geofence algorithm worked as intended, however the GPS module of the ESP32 HUZZAH was not as accurate as we had hoped. The navigation algorithm for the bot had two primary avoidance tactics – a turn value added to the bot’s forward velocity inversely proportional to the distance to the fence and an immediate stop-and-turn algorithm should the bot pass a minimum distance threshold. The distant avoidance algorithm worked as intended, with unanticipated fluctuations due to the low repeatability of the GPS. The stop-and-turn algorithm, in contrast, was only effective in about half of cases; the inconsistency of the GPS often had the bot stopping either several feet short of the geofence or several feet past. Had the larger robot been functional, this likely could have been rectified by increasing the minimum distance to the fence to a value significantly larger than the repeatability error of the GPS, and defining a geofence in a larger area. <br  />
 <br  />
 Overall, many of the elements of our software were tested, to varying extents, but the lack of functionality of the full R8-O7 robot prevented us from testing the software as a unit or fixing errors in the interaction between software segments. With regards to our specific design specifications, the testing results are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p >While the full program could not properly run without the motor driver chip and proper attachment of the sensor array, basic functionality of many of the components has been verified such that it may be tested upon replacement of the PCB. Further, the laser-cut structure of R8-O7 remains incomplete. Given proper time and availability of resources, this project could easily be resumed, building off of our current hardware and software. To that end, it is our intention to, if possible, pass R8-O7 on to willing engineering students within Mustang Band. Though our contribution to the project has had mixed results, we are hopeful that R8-O7 may be completed at a later date. <br  />
